# Population Map 2021

This is a map displaying the world population in each country, colour coded from light to dark blue based on the amount of people.
This map also displays the capital cities in each country and the country name and population number when the mouse hovers of each country

## Design

I used Folium, Geopandas and pandas to create this map and to manipulate the data for each country.
I went with this because I love the simplicity. This is just merely to have interesting information 
about each counntry layed out in a map.

## Run Locally

 - Run this command 'git clone https://github.com/Matt19890303/Population_Map2021.git'
 - 'install pip pandas'
 - 'install pip geopadas'
